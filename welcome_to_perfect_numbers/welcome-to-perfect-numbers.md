# Welcome to Perfect Numbers

## Telling simple stories with data

Hello, and welcome to Perfect Numbers! I’m glad you’re here. This blog will be compromised of (mostly) short articles with data visualization and mediocre prose. If you don’t care about any of the pretense that’s all you need to know. If you want to know more about me and what I hope to do with this blog then keep reading.

## Perfect Numbers (The Math)

Originally defined by Euclid in _[Elements](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookVII/defVII22.html)_[ (VII.22)](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookVII/defVII22.html), _“A perfect number is that which is equal to the sum of its own parts._

That is, perfect numbers are numbers whose proper divisors (divisors not including the number itself) sum to the number itself _._ The smallest such number is 6: 
$$6 = 3+2+1$$

The next is a little less trivial, 28:
$$28 = 14+7+4+2+1$$

I love perfect numbers. They were one of [the first concepts I was introduced to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfKTD5lvToE) as I began falling in love with math- not as a school subject, but as the beautiful and complex set of rules (probably) inherent to our universe. Perfect numbers are not particularly important to the study of mathematics but have been around for at least 2300 years and are still a bit of a mystery. It is unknown if there are infinitely many of them and while none have yet been found, it is an open question if there are any odd perfect numbers. And despite their simplicity, they are exceedingly rare- [the 10th perfect number is 54 digits long](https://oeis.org/A000396). 

## Perfect Numbers (The Blog)

I titled my blog Perfect Numbers because I think it sounds cool. That said, I do hope my blog and its contents will be similar to its namesake in a few ways:

  *  **Simple** : My writing should be very easy to understand. I want to tell honest and approachable stories with data which are both statistically robust and require no background to understand. I find that most data communication is either written by _data people_ who struggle to communicate their complicated methodologies with broad audiences or by _well-adjusted people_ who often misrepresent or misunderstand their data and fail to extract its true value. I hope to fall somewhere in the middle.

  *  **Challenging:** Which is to say, question inducing. I hope to write pieces which have simple initial questions which lead to many more, most of which I’ll fail to answer. Exploring data can often lead you to ask questions about smaller and smaller minutiae until somehow something you find leads you to pondering much bigger questions about what is knowable at all. My stories will hopefully be little windows into this process, with something like a starting and ending.

  *  **Fun:** I don’t take myself very seriously and neither should you. My pieces will be from a variety of topics, none of which I can guarantee will be important in a global sense. My goal is to show how fun playing with data can be for its own sake. The things I think about, and thus will write about may not be things you’re interested in- that’s okay! I am trying to making interesting and entertaining pieces which are mostly about data and how it can guide us to being smarter thinkers about whatever it is we think about.




This blog will obviously differ from its title though in a one big way- it will not be perfect. I will make mistakes. I’ll write bad code and bad prose. I’ll use bad data or bad visualizations. I know this and I accept this. I invite readers to call me out on and take a stab at showing me how wrong I am. I want to show how data exploration can be fun and lead to truth- if I fail on either of those counts, then please let me know.[1](https://perfectnumbers.substack.com/p/welcome-to-perfect-numbers#footnote-1-150539884)

An often stated goal of teams is to be _greater than the sum of their parts._ In my case, since I’m doing this alone, achieving _that which is equal to the sum of its own parts_ will hopefully be sufficient. If Euclid thinks that’s perfection, than who am I to argue.

## About Me

I hope that who I am is not important for understanding my work, nor for making my work important. That said, what I write will of course be influenced by who I am so here’s a little bit about me:

  * My name is Matt Sorak (Matthew if you’d like to annoy me slightly).

  * I was born in Virginia (circa 2000) and raised in Maryland. My allegiances to the latter are far great than to the former.

  * I graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park with a degree in Government and Politics in 2022, and will be attaining my Master’s in Data Science as a Terp in December. I found my first degree extremely interesting but not that useful- my second the opposite.

  * My (admittedly short) professional career has been in housing policy, specifically focused on the regularity barriers which stand in the way of abundance and affordability.

  * I love baseball - both because I grew up playing it and because it is **by far** the best sport for stats nerds. The fact that it can be broken down into a series of batter vs. pitcher matchups may be boring to some, but is essential for establishing the independence of events which I couldn’t be more thankful for.

    * I am predictably a huge O’s fan.




Other interests of mine which could influence future writing include:

  * Video games, board games, sports- really anything with a set of rules for creating competition.

  * Maps- you ever seen one of these things? They are so cool. Here’s a favorite of mine from the New York Times: [A map of every building in the United States](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/12/us/map-of-every-building-in-the-united-states.html)

  * Anything else I think about! It’s my gosh darn blog!




Please feel free to let me know of any topics you’d like me to look into. I always love breaking out of my normal bubble of topics and researching something new.

Okay, that’s it for this introduction. My first couple pieces should come out soon- one on the discovery of a new biggest prime number and one on the 2024 Chicago White Sox being worse than _just_ the worst team of all time. If those topics or anything else I discussed above caught your eye, please subscribe and share this page with someone you know who’d be interested. This whole project is mostly for me to put my musings in one place, but I certainly wouldn’t mind a few eye-balls on my work.

Every bit of my work will be freely available at the [Perfect Numbers GitHub repository](https://github.com/mSorak/Perfect-Numbers) to make it very easy to show me where I screwed up.
