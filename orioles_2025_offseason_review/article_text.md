# Orioles 2025 Offseason Review
Welcome to my 2025 Baltimore Orioles Offseason reviews!

There's a lot to get to so I'll keep my preamble short- not a ton of data in this one. I love baseball, I love the Orioles, and I think I can communicate the deeply statistcally-driven game of baseball in a way that is generally understandable to all. If you like baseball or are proud Marylander, stick around, it'll be fun. If you know absolutely nothing about baseball, this one might not be for you.

We'll start with a quick explainer on key terms to know to understand Major Leauge Baseball's (MLB) off-season. If you are an expert ball-knower, feel free to skip it.  
## Offseason Key Terms
First off, "the offseason" refers to the time between when the MLB season finishes after the conclusion of the World Series- usually late October or early November- and the start of the next season in late March. During this period, there are many players who change teams, either through free angency or trades. Teams make adjustments to their rosters, (usually) trying to improve their teams chances of competing in the next season

Now, let's take a look at some key concepts to know:

### Trades
The majority of players (something like 65%) are signed onto what is or like a rookie contract, signed by players when they join an MLB organization as either a domestic player selected in the MLB draft or an international prospect. Such contracts have various structures which determine pay that we are not going to get into here. The most important part of these contracts is that they grant the team a set period of control over the player. As long as they remain on this initial contract, the team has control over something like the first 6 or 7 seasons of a players Major League career (to say nothing of the time before they play in the Majors). The team may freely terminate the contract or transfer the players contract to another team in exchange for a variety of benefits- including other players, money, and draft picks- a trade.

Trade's are not restricted to players in only these initial contracts, but those initial contracts are what's important for understanding the next important concept to know.

### Free Agency
When a player accrues enough service time (those 6 or 7 seasons) on their initial contract or their contract is voided by their team, they reach free agency. A player being granted free agency means they may negotiate their contract with any team determining length, pay, and other benefits as they wish. These contracts are typically guaranteed- meaning the money owed to the player by the team is required to be paid regardless of player performance, or even terminated employment. Free agency- or a team's fear of losing a player to it- is how the best players make the vast majority of their money and is an oppurtunity to take control of their employment for the first time in typically around 10 years.

#### Options
A common and important detail in negotiated into many MLB contracts is what's called an option. Options allow for either the team or player to shorten or extend a contract. There are basically three type of options:
1. Player Option
2. Team Option
3. Mutual Option.

A player option allows for players to decide whether to stay on their current deal or reach free agency. So let's say a player signs a 1-year, $10 million dollar contract with a player option for an additional 1-year, $10 million. The player plays for the team for one year and in the following off-season, gets to decide whether to opt-in to the additional year, or go to free agency. These benefit players because if they play well they can opt-out and make more money in free agency, but if they play poorly or get injured they have the additional security from opting in. 

A team option is basically the same but it's the team's decision whether to keep the player. The benefit in this case is mostly for the team, allowing them to gain additional years of control without being locked into paying the player if they play poorly.

A mutual option is where both team and player have to agree to continue the contract. These benefit no one, never happen, and aren't worth an ounce more of your precious brain space.

### WAR (A joke)
Baseball is a sport enamored with its statistics. Fans are able to easily track a millions different aspects of player and team performance at any time. And baseball's statistics are far more reflective of performance that other sports' due to basically two reasons:
1. The MLB season features far more games than most other team sports- 162 in just the regular season. This makes for much healthier sample sizes than other team sports.
2. The most important part of the game is the competition between the pitcher and the hitter. Isolating player vs player matchups mean that direct measurement of players performance is less clouded by interactions with other teammates.

Wins Above Replacement (WAR) is an attempt to summarize every part of player performance into one number, which basically attempts to measure the additional wins a player provides to their team over what a replacement level player would provide. The methodologies for different WARs (yes there a different ones*) are complicated and we're note getting into it here but I assure you the more you understand them the more sensible they seem. 

Anyways, WAR attempts to aggregate all aspects of a players game- batting, pitching, baserunning, and fielding- and say ***roughly*** how many theoretical wins that player is worth. It is not perfect by any means but it provides a very convenient snapshort for understanding the holistic value of a player. An average MLB player is worth about 2 WAR in a season, All-Star calliber players are worth maybe 4-5 WAR and 8+ WAR is an MVP-candidate type.

## The Baltimore Orioles
The Baltimore Orioles are a moderatly successful MLB franchise, but have really not been very good for most of the last 30 years. Following a brief period of decent success from 2012-2016, the Orioles descended to an extended stretch of extremely dissapointing play, being one of the truely worst teams in Baseball from 2017-2021. However, a complete rebuild of the team headed by new General Manager (basically the person in charge of operating the team, though not the owner who really controls spending) Mike Elias starting in 2019 began to show fruits in the 2022 season, where the team shockingly finished with more wins than losses. Successful high draft picks granted due to the teams pour performance and revamped player development created an influx of talented young position players, which drove the team's success. In the 2023 season, they were one of the best team's in baseball driven by a top offense, winning their division and the 2nd? most games of any team, and making the playoffs for the first time since 2016. They lost the American League Divisional Series (the quarterfinals) three games to none to the eventual World Series champion Texas Rangers.

2024, was another successful season, though not quite as so. The team won 91 games, the second most in the American League, but lost the divsion to the Yankees. A poor second half of the season where much of the offense slumped lead to a lesser performance. Still, the team qualified for the playoffs as the top wild card team, but were again swept, this time by the Kansas City Royals, who would lose to the Yankees in the next round.

The teams ownership also changed prior to the 2024, with John Angelos, the much derided former owner of the team, selling to an ownership team headed by Maryland native billionaire and philanthropist, David Rubenstein. Heading into the 2024-2025 off-season hopes among fans were high that the ownership may increase payroll flexibility from consistently being near the bottom of the league under Angelos, allowing Elias to bring in additional talented players.

Okay great, now you're caught up! Lets talk about who the Orioles lost following the 2024 season.

## Birds of Summers Past
The Orioles offseason has been driven by free agency, with basically no major trades occuring. Here's everyone they lost:


It's important in an exercise like this review, that I seperate the analysis of how I think the team's moves improved or worsened its' chances to win from how how the moves made me feel. Favorite players leaving the team make people sad and that is equally important to how good the team might be. So first I'm going to talk about how the the departure of some players made me, a big fan who is definetly representative of the general populous (n=1), feel. And then, I'll talk about what the teams top priorities heading into the off season were.

### The Off-Season (Vibes only)
To me, the saddest departure is Anthony Santander who has spent his entire 8 season MLB career with the Orioles. He reached free agency, and signed with Toronto Blue Jays. He was one of the few players to play through much of the Orioles stretch of futility and still be with the team during their recent success. He was a clubhouse leader, charismatic as all get out, and a prolific power hitter, hitting the 6th most homeruns (105) of any player in baseball over the last 3 seasons.

In terms, of on-field play the next most impactful departure, is that of ace pitcher Corbin Burnes, who signed a free agent contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks, publicly stating his very sensible desire of signing with the only team which could allow him to live in his Arizona hous with his family all-year round. He was the best pitcher on the team in 2024, after being acquired by the team prior to that season via a blockbuster trade with the Milwaukee Brewers. While his production and personality will surely be missed, his departure was always the most likely outcome with the Orioles trading for him with only one year of team control standing between him and a massive payday.

There are a few other notable departures:
- Starting pitcher John Means was the best player from the Orioles worst years. He was unfortuneatly largely absent from their recent success, as he's struggled with consequetive major injuries. He signed a $1 Million dollar deal with the Guardians to continue rehabbing and maybe pitch a little at the end of the year.
- James McCann has been the Orioles backup catcher behind All-Star Adley Rutschmann for the past two seasons. He will be missed more for his leadership than his play.
- Danny Coulombe is awesome and I'm so sad that I won't get to watch him anymore.
